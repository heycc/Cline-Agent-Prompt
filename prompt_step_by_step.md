<thinking>
First, I need to create a Python script that demonstrates chatting with OpenAI's API. The key requirements are:

1. Use OpenAI's Python client library
2. Handle API key input securely
3. Implement a conversational loop
4. Include error handling

I'll start by creating the main script file. Since the environment shows only README.md exists, I'll create chat_demo.py. The script needs to:
- Import required libraries
- Get API key from user input
- Set up the OpenAI client
- Create a chat loop with error handling

Next, I should update the README.md with instructions:
- Installation steps
- Usage guide
- API key requirements

Finally, the OpenAI package needs to be installed. I'll use execute_command to run the pip install.

    while True:
        try:
            user_input = input("\nYou: ")
            if user_input.lower() == 'quit':
                break

            response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
                model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
                messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]
            )

            print(f"\nAI: {response.choices[0].message['content']}")

# OpenAI Chat Demo

A simple Python script to demonstrate chat functionality with OpenAI's API.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- OpenAI API key

## Installation

```bash
pip install openai
```

## Usage

1. Get your API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Run the script:
`bash
python chat_demo.py
`
3. Enter your API key when prompted
4. Type your messages and press Enter
5. Type 'quit' to exit

## Notes
- API keys are not stored locally
- Uses GPT-3.5-turbo model by default

<thinking>
The previous diff application failed because the line numbers changed after earlier edits. Let's carefully analyze the current file structure from the provided original content:

The function `chat_with_openai()` ends at line 28, and the `if __name__` block starts at line 30. We need to add two blank lines between them at line 29. The correct diff should target the empty line between the function and the main block.

I'll use read_file to verify the current state before making changes.
